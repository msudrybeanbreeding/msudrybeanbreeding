## Mission Statement

To develop improved dry bean varieties in several commercial classes to serve the bean growers, bean seed producers, and bean industry of Michigan.

The dry bean breeding and genetics program is focused on the development of high yielding, disease and stress resistant cultivars with upright architecture, and improved canning quality in 10 commercial seed classes for production in Michigan. The research work is an ongoing investigation where genetic stocks at different stages of development exist in all commercial classes and new varieties are released after adequate testing.

As different needs and opportunities surface or as disease or quality problems arise, the program looks to address these by incorporating into elite cultivars new genetic sources using various breeding methods aided with genetic tools such as molecular markers. Graduate student training and international activities form the basis for many of the research activities and specific program objectives are detailed separately.
